# MyMusicPlayer
Just a GUI music player I decided to give a go and make using JAVA with Netbeans.
The music player comes with the following functions:
- A playlist system where the songs are in order or ordered randomly
- Play and Pause button
- Buttons that play the next or previous song in the playlist
- Buttons that sets the playlist to random or sets the music to loop
- Sliding volume changer

NOTE!
- This only plays WAV files
- A playlist folder named "Playlist" would have to be made in the MyMusicPlayer, this is where the song files will be placed and read from
- If the "Error: something happened" shows up, just restart it by closing it and make sure it can play WAV files that the clip class can play (also it's in BETA!)
